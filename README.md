Add Braspag payment to your WooCommerce e-commerce!

## Description ##

Add Braspag gateway to WooCommerce.

[Braspag](https://www.braspag.com.br) is a Brazilian payment gateway.

### Development ###

This plugin was developer using the [official docs](https://braspag.github.io) of gateway, without any support.

None of developers have link with Braspag or WooCommerce.

### Payment Methods ###

- Bank Slip
- Credit Card

### Compatibility ###

We tested this plugin against version 8.1+ of WooCommerce.

This plugin do not require [Brazilian Market on WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-extra-checkout-fields-for-brazil/) but suggest your use.

Braspag only requires customer name, but more fields are need for anti fraud or other gateway features.

### Configuration ###

After installing the plugin, activate the payment method and go to the configuration page.

- Activate the payment method.
- Fill the title and description for this payment method.
- Add the "Merchant ID" provided by Braspag.
- Check the option "Sandbox" if the store is not in Production (available for real sale).
- Add the "Secret Merchant Key" provided by Braspag (note that it is different for Sandbox).

After that, just activate the available payment methods.

All of them require a "Provider" provided by Braspag and some settings: read the tips (icon with the question mark) for more information.

### Translations ###

You can [translate Pagador (Braspag) Checkout for WooCommerce](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/woo-checkout-braspag) to your language.

## Installation ##

* Install "Pagador (Braspag) Checkout for WooCommerce" by plugins dashboard.

Or

* Upload the entire `woo-checkout-braspag` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

Then

* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Does it works with Gutenberg? ###

Yes. WooCommerce supports WordPress 5+ and we too.

### Does it works for another e-commerce plugin? ###

Nope. This is a WooCommerce extension.

### I cannot add a payment on order administration ###

To create a payment on admin you should:

- Add a name to "billing address".
- Make sure order is not empty and not paid (needs payment).
- Set Braspag as payment method.
- Transaction ID must be empty.

### Transaction ID? ###

The transaction ID is the Braspag number on your order.

If you already have a Transaction ID (payment was done in Braspag) you must use the relative Order Action to get information from Braspag.

### My orders are not being updated automatically ###

You should configure a URL to receive notification from Braspag.

It should be: "example.com/?wc-api=WC_Checkout_Braspag_Gateway"

Do not forget to change "example.com" to your home url.

### Which URL I should inform to receive Braspag POST Notifications? ###

Check the previous FAQ.

### How about e-wallet? ###

E-wallet is still on ALFA and not fully implemented. The payment method will not show up on checkout page (or order administration).

We DO NOT RECOMMEND, but you can implement it by yourself:

Step 1 - Create your frontend implementation as documented by e-wallet.

Step 2 - Filter the `wc_checkout_braspag_frontend_payment_methods` return to allow e-wallet on front-end.

Step 3 - Create and fill hidden inputs on `braspag/payment-methods/wl-form.php` for the data received by e-wallet:

- braspag_payment_wl_type: the e-wallet type (Braspag docs: Wallet.Type).
- braspag_payment_wl_token: the received token/code from e-wallet (we will fill the required Braspag field for each wallet type - there is no standard field name).
- braspag_payment_wl_installments: payment installments (from Braspag docs, but we are not sure it can be not 1).

Step 4 - Make sure everything is configured on WooCommerce admin (WalletKeys) and on Braspag (environment and production credentials).

If you want to contribute a PR will be appreciated.

### My bank slip number changed ###

We used to sent the "BoletoNumber" to Braspag but it's not required and can cause problems for some providers.

By now we decided to remove this field and alow you to add/change it if "wc_checkout_braspag_bank_slip_number" filter.

This will not change nothing on WordPress dashboard.

### What is PHP? ###

It is a programming language for web development. PHP as like any software it has versions. And we just support 7 (and above).

If you are using PHP in version below 7, please contact your host to update your environment.

### Who are the developers? ###

* [Vizir](http://vizir.com.br/en) is a Brazilian software studio.
* [MÃ¡rio Valney](https://mariovalney.com/me) is a Brazilian developer who works at Vizir Software Studio and integrates the [WordPress community](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mariovalney).
